**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

There is a new article on foodsaving.today about the foodsharing groups in Warsaw, Łódź and Wrocław. The [community forum](https://community.foodsaving,world) sees more and more activity, like [this discussion on Swedish networking](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/cooperation-to-kickstart-foodsaving-in-some-swedish-cities/128) and [this one about a potential Karrot/FSWW co-op](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/a-karrot-co-op/124/).

And according to a post in the [foodsaving worldwide facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/foodsaving.worldwide/) there are people planning some projects in Norway in November. Fittingly, a committed foodsaver from Darmstadt, Germany, has recently moved to the Scandinavian country and is ready to help build an organized movement of foodsavers. Let's see where this leads! :)

## [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de)-dev
Since the last release in August there have been 26 additions to the changelog's 'unreleased' section. And what's most exciting about is that next to 12 bug fixes, 2 bits of refactoring and 2 dev things, we also have 10 actual features! To experience them already, you can go to [foodsharing beta](https://beta.foodsharing.de/).

All these changes are possible because there is a nice and productive atmosphere in the new (and still growing!) developer group of foodsharing.de. Take this screenshot of a conversation last Thursday and get a taste of what I mean:
