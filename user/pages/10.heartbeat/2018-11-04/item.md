There is a new article on foodsaving.today about the foodsharing groups in Warsaw, Łódź and Wrocław. The [community forum](https://community.foodsaving,world) sees more and more activity, like [this discussion on Swedish networking](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/cooperation-to-kickstart-foodsaving-in-some-swedish-cities/128) and [this one about a potential Karrot/FSWW co-op](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/a-karrot-co-op/124/).

And according to a post in the [foodsaving worldwide facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/foodsaving.worldwide/) there are people planning some projects in Norway in November. Fittingly, a committed foodsaver from Darmstadt, Germany, has recently moved to the Scandinavian country and is ready to help build an organized movement of foodsavers. Let's see where this may lead! :)
