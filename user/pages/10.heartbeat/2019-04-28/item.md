**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [Kanthaus](https://kanthaus.online)
Kanthaus now has a free shop that is open two hours per week! On April 23 we held the grand opening and introduced our new concept of 'Open Tuesday': Every Tuesday between 4 and 6 pm we open our free shop, our food share point and our workshops to the public. We want to share items, skills and thoughts and create a frame for local people to meet and discuss sustainability and technology topics. For the grand opening we invited a lot of press which led to two new newspaper articles about us. [Here's one of them.](https://kanthaus.online/de/about/press/2019-04-24_wln-freeshop)

Other things that happened in Kanthaus over the past months are that Tilmann established a jar norm to fill the new shelf that he built in the snack kitchen storage with only three sized of lids. Anja extended our herb bed in the garden, Clara kept on decorating the house, Matthias installed a sound system in the electronics workshop and many more little things as they usually happen here.
