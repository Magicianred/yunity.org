After the oh so long time of waiting we finally have our own connection to the power grid! This means that we can now use our central gas heating independently from our lovely and super helpful neighbor Sven, who provided for us up until now. After an initial period of intense heating to dry the walls, we are now figuering out which temperatures and heating times make most sense.

Easily accessible electricity raises some more sustainability and efficiency questions:
- Does it make more sense to operate a dishwasher to save water, than to do dishes by hand and use gas to heat it up? (Depends on the frequency of usage...)
- Does it make more sense to operate a dryer than to dry laundry in heated rooms? (The answer is a clear yes!)
- Does it make more sense to boil water in a pot on a gas stove or in an electric kettle? (The answer is not clear and depends on how well the pot fits the flame and such. In general the stove is the slightly better choice. We will still operate an electric kettle in the downstairs office soon, since the difference is really not big.)

## About the heartbeat.
The heartbeat is a biweekly summary of what happens in yunity. It is meant to give an overview over our currents actions and topics.
