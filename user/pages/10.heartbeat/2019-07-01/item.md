**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every month.

## [MOVE UTOPIA](https://move-utopia.de/)
MOVE is about to start!

The [program is ready](https://move-utopia.de/de/infos/programm/programm.pdf) and comprises of 46 (!) pages of awesome workshops. Maybe you want to take the time to come up with a personalized time table for yourself in advance..? ;)

## [Kanthaus](https://kanthaus.online)
The most notable change compared to last month is that Kanthaus now has **3** additional members! We are super happy that Nathalie, Thore and Clara feel so much connection and commitment towards Kanthaus that they chose to make this their main base for the months to come. :)

June started with an [orga meeting](https://kanthaus.online/events/2019-05-31_fsde-festival-meeting) of the [foodsharing festival](https://www.foodsharing-festival.org) people. It took place in an otherwise quite empty Kanthaus and lead to a lot of community building among the team members.

_Thanks to the foodsharing festival meeting we had a disco soup during an Open Tuesday!_

[Last month](../2019-05-27) we had the topic of clutter, sorting and shelves and there has been steady progress ever since! Bodhi sorted the material storage in the basement and got rid of some things nobody needed. Nathalie sorted through a lot more things we were given for our free shop and extended the tidy free shop storage shelf. Tilmann and Janina built 8 more shelves for ~6 boxes each and started their plan to empty the room that right now is called 'the crap room'. Anja and Doug sorted the dragon room and freed a lot of space in there. Anja also sorted the dry food storage, the food storage in the basement and the drinks storage so that the new stuff that arrived from the foodsharing action at the Hurricane festival could be integrated much more easily.

## [Foodsaving Worldwide](https://foodsaving.world)
The [foodsharing.de festival](https://www.foodsharing-festival.org) had claimed to be 'international' basically since it started five years ago. And even though it's true because of the involvement of Austria and Switzerland, it implies a bit more, doesn't it?

This year we want to make it _really_ international and host an international meetup for foodsavers from non-German-speaking communities. There is an [invitation on the forum](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/international-meetup-in-berlin-in-august/285) and we are already deep in the planning of the session itself. Looking forward to see as many of you there as possible! :D

## [Karrot](https://karrot.world)

This June was quiet in terms of Karrot development, but some progress still was being made.

Bruno [proposed a sharing feature](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/sharing-feature/281) for Karrot, for encouraging users to share food and other things directly via Karrot.

I added an option to [export pickup feedback as CSV](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/statistics-about-the-amount-of-saved-food/85/27?u=tiltec). This will hopefully help groups to calculate detailed statistics that can't be found on Karrot yet.

Me and Janina added a button to the settings menu to unsubscribe from all notification emails from a group. This was possible before by clicking the "unsubscribe" option from the bottom of a notification email, but we thought it would be useful to have it in the settings menu, too.

Lastly, we are going to have [recurring calls about Karrot development](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/weekly-call-about-karrot-development/289) from now on. We invite interested users and potential developers to join the call and we will document meeting minutes publicly in the forum thread.
