**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [Harzgerode](http://freiefeldlage.de/)

Busy times. While the usual paperwork goes on, preparations for the upcoming season start slowly.
Requests from volunteers willing to participate and help start piling up. Though we are honored by this we are definitely not ready yet to host or even employ those helpers.
So first steps are taken. Writing down tasks, getting material etc. so the place will be prepared to become the regularly mentioned busy anthill as soon as spring arrives.

Meanwhile the chimney of Haus X is finally ready for official approval by the chimney sweeper.
Unfortunately the newly installed plastic tarpaulin covering the leaking roof of the extension of Haus X just flew away in the storm.

We are looking forward to have a professional workshop for the use of a chainsaw at our place in two weeks, so we learn how to safely make firewood from the countless fallen trees in our forests.

## [Kanthaus](https://kanthaus.online)

We seem to have misnamed the 'Month of Calm', because in many ways it's been *more* intense! The energy freed up by not needing to induct new people has been invested in various sessions and discussions: Chandi held a '[cryptoparty](https://www.cryptoparty.in/)' to help people better protect their data, the Karrot Crew demonstrated the developments they made over their work month (more below) and Nick and Matthias presented the [HouseBus](https://github.com/NerdyProjects?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=house&type=&language=) systemâ€”a 'smart-home' project which respects data privacy.

One topic that got a lot of attention was money. Bodhi, Luisa and I organized 4 sessions to investigate how the principle of 'promote sharing, prevent waste' could apply to this strange resource in the Kanthaus context. I was impressed at how open and trusting people were to share their personal situations, hopes and fears on a topic which is normally taboo. Next week we'll be trying to convert the ideas into testable proposals.

I get the general feeling the Month of Calm has been appreciated and that we'll want to hold a similar month next year.

## [Foodsaving Worldwide](https://foodsaving.world)

Recently we had our first person from the U.S. sign up on our forum and immediately post super nice [Greetings from Savannah](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/greetings-from-savannah). The person called wutogui is part of the [Savannah chapter](https://www.facebook.com/SavannahFNB/) of [Food not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net) (FNB) and told us a lot about what they are doing with regards to saving food and sharing it with people in need. Interestingly FNB explicitly identifies _not_ as charity but as anarchic solidarity movement that fights waste and by that is completely in line with our vision of foodsaving. We hope to strengthen this relationship and find ways to support each other regularly! :)
