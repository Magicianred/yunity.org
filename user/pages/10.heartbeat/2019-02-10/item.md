**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

Recently we had our first person from the U.S. sign up on our forum and immediately post super nice [Greetings from Savannah](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/greetings-from-savannah). The person called wutogui is part of the [Savannah chapter](https://www.facebook.com/SavannahFNB/) of [Food not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net) (FNB) and told us a lot about what they are doing with regards to saving food and sharing it with people in need. Interestingly FNB explicitly identifies _not_ as charity but as anarchic solidarity movement that fights waste and by that is completely in line with our vision of foodsaving. We hope to strengthen this relationship and find ways to support each other regularly! :)
