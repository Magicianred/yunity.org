**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [Karrot](https://karrot.world)

The [small release on 2018-12-11](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#629---2018-12-12) contains mostly bug fixes. Janina add an info button about inactive group members to the member list.

During the last two weeks, Tilmann has been steadily working on the improvements to pickup series changes. [It turned out quite different](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-backend/pull/591) than [how it was originally planned](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/better-change-handling-for-recurring-pickups/174). Then main problem was moved recurring pickups. It's quite complex to properly support them, so even though this feature is used from time to time it seems best to disallow moving recurring pickups (at least until we have more developers). The recommended way will be to use the new "disable pickup" feature on the original time and create a one-time pickup at new time.

The Karrot talk at 35C3 [has been scheduled for 2018-12-29 22:50](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9882.html), so we're getting prepared for a late-night session on foodsaving, cooperative structures and open source software. Our slides are still a bit meager, but Janina did a good job pushing it... and it's only a few days left!

The _Winter of Karrot_ now has a [brief entry](https://kanthaus.online/en/events/2019-01-01_winter-of-karrot) at the Kanthaus event page. We received confirmation from Tais that she will most probably attend. That makes the team from summer complete and we're looking forward to the beginning of January for getting started!
