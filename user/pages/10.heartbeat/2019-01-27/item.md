**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [Karrot](https://karrot.world)

As the end of the Karrot winter roadmap is coming up, here's a brief review about the last 3 months:

- [improved the Karrot Android app](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/984), with additional benefits for the mobile page
- [make recurring pickups more predictable](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/pickups-refreshed/199), allow disabling of pickups
- email replies to wall messages now go into a thread
- pickup collectors are now ordered by join date
- show pickup until 30 minutes after start time, to make it easier accessing the chat
- allow unsubscribing from email notifications without logging in
- [added group logo support](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/new-upload-your-group-logo/209)
- automated removal of inactive group members
- started working [on a conflict resolution feature](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/conflict-resolution-with-possibility-to-remove-user-from-group/201) - to be released in February!
- held [a talk at 35C3](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9882-the_foodsaving_grassroots_movement)
- held the [Winter of Karrot](https://kanthaus.online/events/2019-01-01_winter-of-karrot) to work together on Karrot development
- ... and much more, have a look [at the changelog](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)!

This has also been [posted to the community forum](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/collecting-and-voting-on-feature-requests-for-karrot-spring-2019/217)) and if you want to have a say on what should be implemented next, you can comment on this thread!

We started having weekly meetings about the Karrot Bike Kitchen project. Bruno and Sebastian arranged usability tests amongst the Gothenburg users and Janina started summarizing the results. Nick prepared to implement end dates for pickups and Tilmann added a store conversation prototype.

Janina and Tais have been working hard to connect the conflict resolution UI to the backend. They did a good job to slowly move from mock data towards integrating a data store and making API calls.
