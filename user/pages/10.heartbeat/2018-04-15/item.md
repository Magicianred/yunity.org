## [Foodsaving Worldwide](https://foodsaving,world)
- The [World Disco Soup Day 2018](https://www.slowfood.com/what-we-do/international-events/world-disco-soup-day/) is coming up! In less than two weeks, on April 28 [Slow Food Youth Network](https://www.facebook.com/slowfoodyouthnetwork/)'s 2nd global event will take place - so there's still time to take part! It's easy, really, and an amazing way to reach out to people about food waste, while having a lot of fun at the same time! Just [join the organizer's group in facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/339657459716739/) or directly [follow the instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejcoJ4ccw-PhqzMNuPi3kQ-VpvO2_yK6450UxSp9pq4/edit) and join in a distributed but global anti food waste party!

- [Foodsharing Ecuador](https://www.facebook.com/foodsaving.world.Ecuador/) becomes the pioneer foodsaving project in Latin America! It already spread from [the capital](https://www.facebook.com/groups/foodsharing.ecuador/) to a second city - [Cuenca](https://www.facebook.com/groups/foodsharing.cuenca/) - and the foodsavers of Quito become the go-to address for other potential Foodsavers from e.g. Peru and Argentina as well!

- [Foodsharing i Östersund](https://www.facebook.com/groups/194858781249133/) is getting the ball rolling! They hold events all the time, have regular cooperations with stores and a Food-Share Point. They also already [contributed Swedish documents](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/222855174/Example+letter+to+a+store+EN+SE) to our knowledge library and are in frequent contact with us and other Swedish foodsavers. Way to go! :D

## [Kanthaus](https://kanthaus.online)
A lot of technological/sustainable achievements have been made in the past weeks.
The roof of the sheds across the garden is now full of crappy GS-50 PV-panels that were still lying around at the station in Bad Dürrenberg.

_Bodhi connects the solar panels._

This gives us about 1.3 kW at ideal conditions and usually still more then 100 W at crappy conditions (cloudy, no direct sun..). Since we have a basic load of about 200-500 W during the day and 50-100 W at night (depending on the amount of people at Kanthaus and other factors), we have will have quite some excess energy a lot of times. We cannot put this energy into the grid yet, so we had the idea to “store” the excess energy in the form of hot water. For this purpose we installed one of the old 80 L boilers that were still in K22 in the bath- and shower room in K20-2-1. We can now have hot showers without paying for energy, yay!

This is still a very improvised installation. Within the next weeks Matthias and Tilmann will build a system (using [the house-bus already in place](https://handbook.kanthaus.online/housebus.html)) to control the energy flow according to the current weather conditions and energy consumption. When that's done we will probably also install more boilers in the other floors of K20. We will then have hot water in the ground floor (for dumpster washing and washing machine) and the first floor (for dish washing and cooking)!
