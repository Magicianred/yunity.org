In the last months this blog was neglected, but that doesn't mean that nothing happened. No really, not at all! Our communication just shifted to our wiki even more, so that our heartbeat - which basically is a communuty report - is published on there every other week.

So if you want to stay updated, you should check it out ~~[here](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=YUN)~~!

~~(We know this is not the fanciest solution, and from the very beginning there have been thoughts on how to integrate it on this website directly, but so far nobody had time to implement it. Sorry...)~~

**UPDATE 2017-05-08**: The heartbeat has now been [integrated into the new yunity.org website](../), for your fullest convenience.
