**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## Foodsaving Worldwide
The [Hackweek](../2017-09-17) is over and we are back to working together in a remote way. But we're still feeling the momentum brought to us through the time of being closely together and we achieved quite much:
* We have a prototype for a static info page that is to be reachable via foodsaving.world
* Our instance of Karrot will move to app.foodsaving.world to make it more clear that foodsaving world and Karrot are _not_ the same
* Karrot gets steadily refactored and rewritten and foodsharing.de development sees a surge of activity. Read more about these two topics down below:

## Karrot

## Foodsharing.de development

## Kanthaus Wurzen

## WuppDays Dargeluetz Planning
