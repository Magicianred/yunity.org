**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## Foodsaving Worldwide
The [Hackweek](../2017-09-17) is over and we are back to working together in a remote way. But we're still feeling the momentum brought to us through the time of being closely together and we achieved quite much:
* We have a prototype for a static info page that is to be reachable via foodsaving.world
* Our instance of Karrot will move to app.foodsaving.world to make it more clear that foodsaving world and Karrot are _not_ the same
* Karrot gets steadily refactored and rewritten and foodsharing.de development sees a surge of activity. Read more about these two topics down below:

## Karrot

## Foodsharing.de development

## Kanthaus Wurzen

## WuppDays Dargeluetz Planning

## Harzgerode

Stuff is happening again! The 3 "getting to know each other" meeting are over and the community is beeing founded. 
There was a very concrete and motivating meeing about who "could" move in right away and under what basic conditions.
It seemd to be sort-of-consesus that things like paying rent (and money in general) and using spaces would be solved solidarily. The group that met generate enough monthly and one-time fundung to pay for the upkeep of the place and the heating system (which is already ordered, apparently). A possible scenario could be for the yunity-isch people here could be: make one or two very improvised clay ovens in the Inspektorenhaus before winter, sleep there and have a community room that can be wood-heated (at least a bit ;)  And use community rooms in Ost for working and hanging out, spending time with the other people of the community, etc. In long term (from next spring) concentrate on making the Oberarzthaus nice and usable, do some immidate things now to not support further decay. [Bodhis perspective]
