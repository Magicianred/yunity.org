For months, many volunteers participated in the search for a logo... then, on January 26, Manuele posted a [message into our Slack chat](https://yunity.slack.com/files/manuelecarlini/F0KD69Q3B/logo-yunity.jpg):

> Hello @channel !
> After some months of discussion and passionate contribution we finally have the first version of the logo.
> 
> I want to thank @manuelw @michi @vinicio @joachim @mel  and all the people than helped in the process. Please have a look and give us some feedback,
> but remember:
> 
> This is just a symbol,
> now itâ€™s up to us to put values in it, meaning, messages of love,
> and spread out to the world.
> 
> Always Rock and Roll!

All of us were happy to see the results and were eager to use it everywhere: on the website, on facebook, on youtube... 
the next steps are the [definition of a color scheme](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/Color+Scheme) and adjustment of [all our publications](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/PR+Channels).

We are happy to have you here!
