**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [Karrot](https://karrot.world)

Just two weeks ago we had the [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de) hackweek and now it was karrot's turn!

## [Foodsaving Worldwide](https://foodsaving.world)

Due to no networking people showing up for the karrot hackweek, Janina mostly concentrated on karrot. Still, some communicative tasks were tackled as well:

- Basically all the people we're already in touch with were contacted again and news were exchanged.
- We finally put the [English version of the article about Foodsharing Poland](https://foodsaving.today/en/blog/2018/02/27/fsps-in-poland), which was first published by cojestgrane24 a year ago, on foodsaving.today.

On the day the Karrot hackweek started, the Foodsharing February officially came to an end and was celebrated with our biggest public event so far: The pancake KifA!

Around 25 Wurzeners came to our house and spend the afternoon/evening with us! We were overwhelmed by the interest and super happy that all the nice pancakes we prepared were eaten over talks about sharing culture. This first KifA definitely was a huge success and we're already looking forward to the next one!

More and more people start coming by because they've heard of us and want to say hi. That's awesome! [Our facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kanthaus.online/) has almost a hundred likes already and posts on there regularly elicit quite some reactions.

Other noteworthy events were the hosting of our first [official couchsurfer](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/hopefullyunique), who spend the night and left a nice reference, and our first [workawayer](https://www.workaway.info/367874778735-en.html), who just arrived and will probably stay for some weeks. And for people more interested in structural matters the most important news could be that our Constitution saw it's first major amendment, which prescribes member revaluations, adds a visitor section and a completely rewritten evaluation paragraph, as well as some minor changes in phrasing. Bear with us though, because there are still mistakes (!), the German version is not updated yet and we are planning the next big amendment already...
