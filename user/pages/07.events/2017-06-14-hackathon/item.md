We held the
[first Coding for Change hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/566469526884248/)
last October at [co-up](http://co-up.de) (thanks co-up!) and it was a great success. A lot of energy went into the projects and much progress was made. You can read
[our retrospective](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/Hackathon+Retrospective) for the details.

It's time for the next one!

They very generously provide the space to us for free, so please [support them](http://co-up.de/support-us.html).

### What?

We have three great projects and invite new and existing developers to join for a weekend of meeting and coding.

If you are not already involved with one of the projects and you want to attend please get involved _now_ so you are ready to start coding when you arrive!

These are all projects built by grassroots communities and run on a shoestring budget (or no budget), they are all great and need your support.

(If you have a project that you think fits in with these and would like to join our hackathon, please pester someone in the _#hackathon_ channel in [slack](https://slackin.yunity.org/)).

## [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de)

Helps over 150 thousand people to save and share food.

There are two parts to the application.

##### 1) existing server-rendered PHP application

This is the main site, and is currently being turned into a laravel app by the original developer as part of [Prototype Fund - round 1](https://prototypefund.de/projects/round1/).

##### 2) new _light_ version

A Symfony + Doctrine RESTful API built on top of the existing database with a shiny [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) / [Quasar](http://quasar-framework.org/) mobile-friendly frontend focused on the tasks you need to do _now_ - e.g. see your next pickups, reply to messages, and contact the other people doing a pickup with you.

See [our writeup](https://devblog.foodsharing.de/2017/04/18/easter-foodsharing-hackathon.html) for details and screenshots.
