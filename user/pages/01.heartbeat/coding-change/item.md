A hackathon dedicated to prevent waste and to expand the movement of sharing!

![https://www.facebook.com/events/566469526884248/](hackathon_v7-0-0-0-0-1475319595.png)

##Purpose 1
yunity would like to invite you to join the endeavour to look into the existing foodsharing.de php-code. The website helps over 150.000 people to save food and to share it with others. <br>
https://gitlab.com/groups/foodsharing-dev

###Challenge
4 years ago foodsharing.de was programmed by a single programmer - “quick and dirty” as developers say. There are problems with the readability and extensibility of the code.

##Purpose 2
yunity is developing a foodsaving tool (in multi-languages) to bring the foodsharing movement worldwide. We got over 50 inquires from people who want to start foodsharing at their local place. Together with the tool, yunity will be going to this places to support the kick-start and to connect local sharing initiatives (like free-shops, repair-cafes, urban gardening, etc.) through a common interest: food.

###Challenge
yunity is looking for developers with experience in Python and AngularJS who would like to join the development team.
