Less than a week left! We can hardly believe it. Writing code, fixing-bugs, throwing that code away and making new code, documenting, serving, chatting with design, chatting with user needs, revising the data model... Sufficient to say we've been busy.

Some of the things we've been up to:
<ul>
    <li>Steady improvement of our <a href="https://github.com/yunity/yunity-core/wiki">GitHub wiki</a>.
    <li>Implementing users and chat API with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a>.
    <li>Progress is being made with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> (basic search is functional on map using location based data).
    <li>Complete framework for test and validation.
    <li>Backend took <a href="https://github.com/yunity/yunity-core/graphs/contributors">a leap</a> forwards! Now we can continue integration with the frontend. <li>Restructuring of the <a href="http://www.yunity.org/">yunity.org</a> page is ongoing - you may have noticed - and should reach stability soon.
    <li>And last but not least, we've chosen to use the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPL 3.0 license</a> for source code.
</ul>

Love,
