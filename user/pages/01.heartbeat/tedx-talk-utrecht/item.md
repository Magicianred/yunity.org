As some of you may have noticed, we advertised an ominous TEDx Talk in Utrecht for a while on the bottom of our landing page. It took place on January 27th and was held by Raphael Fellmer, co-founder of foodsharing.de as well as first believer in yunity. Now the official clip was finally published on TEDxâ€™s Youtube channel!

In this 15 minutes long talk, Raphael talks about how you can live the change you wish to see in the world. He tells the story of his 5 year long money strike, the success story of foodsharing and how all of this led him to the idea of creating yunity.

We are really happy with this opportunity to promote our project and are so proud of how well he made use of it! Subtitles will be available soon, but you English speakers out there can already enjoy the inspiring talk by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqj6fH2i9go).
