Ciao Dear techies!

TL:DR; In the 3 weeks during the [WuppDays](http://project.yunity.org/wuppdays)
we layed the foundation of [yunity](http://www.yunity.org/), a new platform
to share and save food, items, skills and resources using AngularJS,
Bootstrap, Django, Elastic, Postgres...  and we need your help!

WuppDays was an excellent experience, a
lot of dreaming, planning, some celebrating and a lot of doing. The vision
of the project was determined to be:

**Mission:**

*We encourage relationships where people can share unconditionally their
time, skills and resources. Through these connections and communities we
prevent waste and raise awareness for a sustainable way of living.*

**Vision:**

*A society based on cooperation, trust and self-determination which allows
people to live to their full potential and to preserve ecosystems for all
living beings.*

## Developer Review

For the 12 of us who were present in Malo, Italy on the Developer team, it
was overwhelmingly positive despite a bit of a challenging start: At first
it was decided to start writing a new platform using Python, but a review
of the existing PHP code-base for foodsharing led to a discussion about
whether the time and resources at WuppDays would be better spent
refactoring the existing code-base, or rewriting from scratch.

Points for refactoring included

* Large, used and usable code-base
* "Better to know your enemies [and fix them]"
* Current development team familiar with PHP and existing code-base
* More rapid improvements for existing foodsharing community in Germany


Points for rewriting included

* Moving away from PHP has benefits (easier security, cleaner code)
* Refactoring could take a long time
* Starting from scratch, could produce a clearer and better designed platform
* Creating as a team something completely new

In the end, a vote by systemic consensus led to the selection of rewriting
over refactoring. Based on the skills of the team and the quality of
existing resources, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) was selected for the front-end, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) was
selected for the back-end and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) was
selected as database.

So please get in touch if you are at all interested in getting involved! We
communicate in real time using Slack (email back to request access), check
our email, use a repository hosted on yunity [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yunity) (star it if you like the project that helps to
find more developers!) and keep track of our tasks on [Waffle](https://waffle.io/yunity/yunity)

##Next Wuppdays

The **next Developers WuppDays will be from 13th - 22nd of November in Mainz**,
Germany in a wonderful house project where you will be provided with food,
shelter, good vibes and bunch of very committed people who want to code to
change the world! If you are have time to come and join this hackathon,
please fill out [this form](http://project.yunity.org/what-we-need). We are
already **6 Developers who will be coding for yunity in Mainz**, but there is
space for some more, so apply now! Please indicate in the form in the
motivation if you can come for the whole period or if just some days, which
ones. For the group spirit and workflow we appreciate if everyone comes for
the entire 10 days.
