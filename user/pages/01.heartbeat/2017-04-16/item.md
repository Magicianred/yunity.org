### [foodsharing.de](http://foodsharing.de)

*   A [foodsharing.de](http://foodsharing.de) hackathon is happening in Berlin right now. The goal is to build a lightweight interface to the [foodsharing.de](http://foodsharing.de) page for mobile users, supporting features like chat messages and upcoming pickups. Developers (Nick, Raphael, Matthias) are getting acquainted with [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) PHP framework.
*   The code is located on Github: [https://github.com/foodsharing-dev](https://github.com/foodsharing-dev)

## Wurzen Planning.

Matthias published this [announcement in the yunity Slack](https://yunity.slack.com/messages/C3RS56Z38/):

> So, people, there is actually a small problem regarding the Wurzen Project: The core team currently consists of Bodhi, Doug, Frank and me ([Matthias Larisch](/wiki/display/YUN/2017/04/16/yunity+heartbeat+2017-04-16)). And that is not enough. Is there some people here who would commit to participating in the community processes currently going on (and on hold) in Harzgerode? People who would come with us to Wurzen before May and start working on the house? You are not obliged to stay there forever - but currently the motivation is very much down because of the lack of general commitment and contribution.

That fits with the general change of direction in yunity that was the reason for the "why-yunity" meetings. Bodhi gives more insight [in this interview (in German)](http://www.freiwilligenmagazin.de/ein-projekt-zwischen-scheitern-und-aufbruch-im-interview-mit-yunity/).

The current plan is to work more closely with the [HWR e.V.](http://hwr-leipzig.org/) and extend the team outside of the traditional yunity circles.

## yunity Website.

The [yunity.org](http://yunity.org) website is severely outdated, which already confused contributors to the foodsaving tool. Chrisi, one of our yunity members, is working on a Wordpress-based redesign of the existing page, but there is not enough content for it to replace the existing page.

In the meantime, Nick proposed to create a much simpler page, based on the [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/). It would have a main page with links to the sub-projects and the yunity heartbeat would also be move there. All other content would be moved to sites of sub-projects. More information can be found in [his proposal](https://slack-files.com/T0B6WCFM5-F4WABD5FE-98cb9c1fe9).
