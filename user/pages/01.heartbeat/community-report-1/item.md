**A community report** is a paper **to reflect** on what was happening over the last weeks. And to be honest: nobody knows what exactly happened, but at least this community report tries to highlight adventures and developments.

The structure of the yunity network is quite fluid. To grasp **what is happening and how to participate** seems sometimes a bit difficult if you're not full time involved. The following includes some of the activities that took place, **tasks we solved, issues we faced and solutions we came up with.**

####Where are we?

We're full of excitement, working simultaneously on many tasks. Some are visible, some are on a personal level within ourselves. There is no other way to change the world before changing ourselves.

*"Trust and transparency between people is key to social relations and working together for change."*


####What are we doing?
A lot and everything. 

- touring with yunity 
- coming closer to a Wupphouse
- wuppdays/wuppbreak 
- Presenting the [new frontend](https://mvp-design.yunity.org) (Lars Wolf) - 
(you can log in as l@l.de; password "123").
- Starting the [new frontend structure](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend) (Flo Hoyer)  
- Raphael Fellmer and Martin Schott left yunity, party goes on with yunity and sharecy
