**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [foodsaving.world](https://foodsaving.world)

We won the [Taiwanese g0v grant](https://grants.g0v.tw/)!
Specifically the 2017 Autumn g0v Civic Tech Prototype Grant, which will support the necessary steps for foodsharing Taiwan to really start using the foodsaving tool. Thanks to Stefan, who wrote a [long and detailed application](https://goo.gl/DykQfV), where he explained the need for foodsaving and the advantages of having a platform to do so, we will now receive 500.000 TWD. After taxes (which will be huge since Stefan is a foreigner) we will use the money to finance local things for Taiwan first of course, like printing flyers and paying travel costs for meetings and presentations. What's left afterwards will be distributed between the active contributors to the foodsaving tool using a time tracking system.

## About the heartbeat.

The heartbeat is a biweekly summary of what happens in yunity. It is meant to give an overview over our currents actions and topics.

### When and how does it happen?

Every other weekend we collect information on a wiki page and publish it on Sunday or the following Monday as a wiki blog article.

Afterwards we add a nice abstract and share it on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yunity.org/).

### How to contribute?

Talk to us in [#heartbeat](https://yunity.slack.com/messages/heartbeat/) on [Slack](https://slackin.yunity.org) about the content, the layout or any other heartbeat related issues and ideas!
