To further fuel the progress on [foodsaving.world](https://foodsaving.world) and the foodsaving worldwide network, Tilmann invites coders and foodsaving activists to a lovely place in the Bavarian countryside.

## Why?

We will

- improve existing functionality on foodsaving.world
- think about and plan new features
- discuss ways to increase the foodsaving network together with foodsharing.de

Besides that, expect to have a great time in beautiful nature together with lovely people!

If you have another idea what you would like to do with us, please get in contact. (See end of this article)

## When and where?

The **Foodsaving worldwide summer camp & hackweek** will take place from _2017-09-13 to 2017-09-20_ in [_Neuried, Markt Indersdorf_](https://goo.gl/maps/Wn8j7sND18J2)

## So how will we...

Some considerations on how life will be during that week.

### ... eat?

- Are you ready to feast on saved food that comes from dumpster diving and from foodsharing cooperations in the region?
- Are you willing to sort good from perished food, wash it and prepare it together?

### ... sleep?

- Would you mind sleeping in the same room with others? That will mean people coming in late at night and/or talking together in the morning.
- Are you comfortable with sleeping in a tent? That's usually the best way to have a really quiet time.

### ... get along with neighbors and parents?

- Are you willing stop others from talking loudly outside late at night (i.e. after midnight)?
- Are you aware of others being bothered by rooms or places that are dirty or unorderly?


### ... get there?

The place is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, so it might be a challenge to get there without an own car.

**By train/bus**: From Munich, there is some public transport to get here. Use the travel planner http://efa.mvv-muenchen.de with these destinations, sorted by distance to goal:

    Neuried (Indersdorf), Neuried
    Ainhofen (Obb), Ainhofen
    Lanzenried (Kr DAH), Lanzenried
    Hilgertshausen, Post

**By Hitchhiking**: from A9, get off in Allershausen and then to Neuried.
From A8, get off in Odelzhausen, to Markt Indersdorf, then to Neuried.
But be aware of the fact that Neuried is so tiny that maybe even the locals might not know it. So be sure to know where you want to go!

For those coming with their car, there are roughly three parking lots for visitors.
